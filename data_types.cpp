DATA TYPES
A program written in the C++ language , in a procedural ir an object-oriented paradigm, needs to manipulate data. To  make manipulating data efficient, C++
recognizes different data types. The data types can be divided broadly into two as:
    Built-in
    User defined

Built-in datatypes-: are those defined by the language. The language distiguishes to groups in this category: 
        fundamental or 
        compound
The language also divides  the user-defined type into two categories: 
        enumerated
        class

        Integer type

        a number without a fraction.There are three types of integers
        the signed types can be positive or negative; the unsigned types are only positive
